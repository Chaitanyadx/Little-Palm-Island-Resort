    <p class="main_dining_room" align="center">
    Palm Island was originally known as Prune Island. It was leased in 1966 for 99 years by Americans,
    John and Mary Caldwell, from the St. Vincent and the Grenadines government for US $1/year.
     The caveat was that they built a hotel to provide employment for local people.
      At that time the island was uninhabitable with a swampy, low lying interior,
       but with stunningly unspoilt white sand beaches on the shoreline.</p><br><br>

    <p class="main_dining_room" align="center">
    The Caldwells planted coconut palms to reclaim the land, 
    a practice Johnny had learnt from previous projects, giving him the nickname “Johnny Coconuts”.
     And so Palm Island evolved and by leasing a few select building plots for private homes the funds were raised to
      construct a ten-bedroom hotel, The Palm Island Beach Club, which they ran for the next thirty years.</p><br><br>

    <p class="main_dining_room" align="center">
    In 1999 the hotel was purchased by the current owners, James Lane, an Englishman, and Rob Barrett, an American.
     Extensive renovations followed to create forty-one luxurious rooms and suites, a sumptuous Spa and beautiful facilities for hotel guests.
      Two of the private residences were also purchased to create spectacular villas for small groups of friends or family.
     Whilst a plant nursery was crafted to cultivate fresh produce and herbs for the restaurants.</p><br><br>

    <p class="main_dining_room" align="center">
    Although the geography of this area can sometimes be challenging, the ethos here is always to come back stronger.  
    And so the story of Palm Island is ever moving forward and it is this element which we hope you, as our guests,
     will love and appreciate and want to be part of, as much as we do. We are passionate about preserving the natural beauty,
      the flora and fauna, and of course the very important jobs for the local community, that we have inherited.</p><br><br><br>

    Palm Island is just one of the stunningly beautiful, peaceful islands in the Grenadines,
    stretching between St. Vincent and Grenada. With Bequia, the largest island to the north,
     Palm Island is about ten minutes away from Union Island, the main local commercial center and transfer hub.
    Other neighboring islands include the Tobago Cays and Mustique.</p><br><br><br><br></font>
